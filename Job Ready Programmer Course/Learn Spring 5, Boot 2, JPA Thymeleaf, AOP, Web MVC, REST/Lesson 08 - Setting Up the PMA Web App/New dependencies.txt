During the next episodes of the course, we're going to create a PMA (Project Management Application).
In this lesson we're only going to set up the project, but some new dependencies are introduced:

- Spring Web:
	This imports Spring MVC (Model View Controller)

- H2:
	This is an embedded database. Think of it as a temporary database which is used for testing. 

- JPA:
	This is the Java Persitence API. This is used for storing, accessing, and managing Java objects in
	a relational database. It makes working with data a lot easyier. JDBC was used back in the days,
	but this is faster and easier.

- Thymeleaf:
	To build html pages.

- Dev Tools:
	Changes in your code will reflect in your browser.
