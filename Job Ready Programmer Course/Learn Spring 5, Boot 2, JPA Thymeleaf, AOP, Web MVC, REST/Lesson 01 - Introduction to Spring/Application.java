	//SPRING: The original intent of the spring framework was to make developing java applications easier. 
	
	//FRAMEWORK: Supports multiple languages. 
	
	//WHAT DOES IT PROVIDE: Every software application has various infrastructural requirements. For example: the application 
	//must connect to a database or connect with an external API. Connections and passwords need to be configured and 
	//also how your application is going to run on different platforms. Doing this in Java alone is a nightmare, Spring provides
	//this infrastructural support on the application level. 
	
	//SPRING BOOT: Is the icing on the cake... Spring Boot is a component of the Spring Framework that can kick start your
	//application in minutes. Spring Boot uses various defaults for you that comply with best practices in developing various
	//kinds of applications. We don't have to worry about what is the best way to create an application.
