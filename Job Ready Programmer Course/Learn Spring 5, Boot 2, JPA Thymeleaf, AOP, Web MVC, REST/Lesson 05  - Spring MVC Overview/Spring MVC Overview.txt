The controller is a big piece of Spring Application development. Especially with web apps. 
Any HTTP request that comes to your application will be handled by a controller. 

These controllers are part of the MVC framework. 

MVC stands for Model View Controller. 

What is a view:
	- Anything that displays something, like the HTML pages that we write. 
	- The controller interacts with the view.

What is a model:
	- The controller also interacts with the model. 
	- If you are working with data in your application, that is where the model aspect comes in. 
	- If we submmit a form that will be inserted into a database, a model object will handle this. 

- Where does the controller fit in:
	- The controller sits in the middle of the HTTP requests, the model and the view. 

Until now, we've hardcoded HTML inside of the controller methods. This is not the correct way of doing it. 
In the next lesson we're going to delete the HTML code from the controller class and create HTML files that
we store in the templates foler.
