Keeping all the html template files in the templates folder can become a bit unorganized. It's better to create
folders for each subject. When referencing to the templates, put the folder name first like:
return "emplyees/new-employee";

LAYOUT HTML FILE:
	- If a certain style or layout is needed, it is not good practice to copy all this code in every html template.
	it is better to create a layouts.html file in the templates folder. Here you put all the html/css code.
	If we have a navigation bar in the layouts file, we can reference to it from all other templates.

IN THE LAYOUTS FILE:
	<nav th:fragment="navBar">
		<!-- Some code that creates the navbar -->
	</nav>

IN THE OTHER HTML FILES:
	<nav th:replace="layouts :: navBar"></nav>

This will keep your code a lot cleaner. If we reference to a certain style, we place this between the <head> tags.
so:
	<head>
		<style th:replace="layouts :: navStyle">
	</head>

If there is actual content in it, it has to be placed inside of the body.
	<body>
		<div th:replace="layouts :: navBody">
	</body>
