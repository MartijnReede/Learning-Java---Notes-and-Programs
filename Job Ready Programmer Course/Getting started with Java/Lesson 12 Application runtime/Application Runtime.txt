How is java code organized?

	1. Package
	2. Java class file
	3. Java class file (specification) blueprint to create actual objects.
	4. Methods (behavior)

Objects come into existence during application runtime.
	- If the application is not running, there are no objects. 
	- They will show their behavior during application runtime.
