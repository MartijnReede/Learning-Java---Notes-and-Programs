JDBC = Java Database Connectivity. 

Its essentially an API that communicates with a database. 

This database can run on your own computer, or somewhere else on a server.
The process of connecting to it will be the same. 

There are different database vendors like:
- Postgres
- Microsoft
- IBM
- Oracle

Although the vendors are different, they basically work the same with the language SQL. 
If you know SQL you can basically work with any database. 

Overview of JDBC:

JAVA APPLICATION CONTAINS:
- The application
- JDBC API
- Vendor driver software

VENDOR DRIVER SOFTWARE:
- Connects to the database. 

So to connect a Java application to a database, we have to download the driver from the corresponding vendor.
If we add the driver to the classpath, we can connect to the specific database. This driver cannot be used
for other vendors. 

In this course we're going to connect to a MySql database. 

To build a JDBC application we have to download:
- MySql server
- MySql workbench
- Driver (connector)

To work with the MySql server, it has to run as a service on your computer. When installing, it will
ask if you want to run it as a service on the background when you are starting your computer. Click yes...
