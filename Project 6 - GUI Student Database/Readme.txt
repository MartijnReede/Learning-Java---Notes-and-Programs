Goals for this program: 

Make a student database in a GUI and make it as bug-free as possible. If the user types in wrong data, the program must
recognize this, tell the user what went wrong and ask the user to try again. 

Database functionality: 
	
	Adding students to the database:
		- Program asks how many students will be added.
		- User can type in first name, last name, and select the grade of the student.
		- When confirmed, a unique ID will be generated with the first number corresponding to the grade of the student. 
	
	Remove students from the database:
		- Program asks what student needs to be removed from the database. 
		- If the entered name corresponds with a student in the database, the corresponding student will be removed. 
	
	Manage classes:
		- Program asks for what student classes will be managed.
		- Classes can be enrolled from a menu. Each class costs $600,-, adding the amount to the total dept of the student.
		- Classes can be canceled as well, removing $600,- from the total dept of the student. 
		- Enrolled classes and total dept of the student are shown on the screen.
	
	Manage payments:
		- Program asks for what student payments will be made. 
		- Payments can be made, reducing the dept of the student.
