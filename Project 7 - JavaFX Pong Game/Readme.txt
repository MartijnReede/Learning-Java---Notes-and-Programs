Goals for this program:

Making a Pong game in JavaFX:
	- With multiple levels. The ball speed increases and player size decreases when leveled up.
	- The level increases when the player scores 4 points. After leveled up, scores of the player and the computer are reset to 0. 
	- If the computer wins 4 points, the player is game over right away and is redirected to the main menu. 
	- If level 3 is beaten, the player won and is a true master of Pong. 
	- After winning or losing a point, the player is notified and the round stops. The program counts from 3 to 1, and then a new round starts.
